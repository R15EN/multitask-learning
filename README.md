# Multi Task Learning with Keras


This uses a dataset that includes CSV images of faces labeled based on age, gender, and ethnicity.
Dataset from here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv?datasetId=855240&sortBy=voteCount

Three simple models are we used. Each with one output. We also used the Keras functional API to implement a neural network with multiple outputs.
